Personal operating system for my life
# How I express myself
|Area  |Example|
|---|---|
|Physically |Hugs & high fives. Quick to laugh. My face responds faster than my brain can remember that my face responds fast. Verbally.|
|Emotionally | I'm most likely sharing my emotions freely If I feel there is little risk of being misunderstood. This summarizes my thoughts on feelings-https://overcast.fm/+BmH-1b7vs/14:31 I try to be generous with my time and share as many positive emotions as I can.|
|Spiritually | With a denominational christian upbringing I have a belief and experience with a higher power|
|Intellectually|  I enjoy thought provoking situations & content. 


  * Topics like:  
  * Mindfulness
  * Responsibility
  * Stoicism
  * Mythology
  * Fitness
  * Cinema
are interesting to me. Rational thought, seeing things as they are rather than how we expect them to be, are how I best express myself. |
